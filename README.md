# I2C Controller and Slave Interface

This project implements a Verilog-based I2C controller and slave interface for handling I2C communication. The I2C controller module manages master operations, including start conditions, address transmission, read/write data handling, and stop conditions. The I2C slave interface responds to master commands, processes address and data transmissions, and generates acknowledgments as required by the I2C protocol.
